Throughout September and October 2023 Women in Data® fielded a nationwide survey called ‘The Hidden Reality’ - the research was the first in the UK to quantify and understand the societal, personal and economic impact of Violence against Women and Girls. Hackathon squads will be tasked with using sophisticated analytical and AI techniques, to explore and understand the findings. They will uncover new insights which will be delivered as a comprehensive overview of the current situation with recommendations to help legislators, organisations and survivor groups make data-led decisions that can affect change.

**Aims for the hackathon:**
- :boom: Find insights in survey data that can help policy makers reduce the risk of violence against women and girls
- :grey_question: Identify other areas for future surveys / analyses to investigate further
